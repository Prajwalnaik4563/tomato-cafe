            <p>A "Non-veg and Veg cafe" that serves meat-based dishes alongside 
                vegetarian options. It's a common term, especially in India,
                 to differentiate between restaurants or sections of a menu that include meat
                 including poultry and seafood from those that are strictly vegetarian. 
                  In essence, it's a cafe where you can find both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items.</p>
